# MVP Technical Test

This new platform must be scalable and flexible to support our continuous growth. We want to implement a micro-service architecture and the first part of the project is to develop a to do web app with two sets of REST endpoints and the UI to display the data: USERS CRUD and USER’s TASKS CRUD.


## Getting Started

Just modify URL's paths in work directory files, and database access data in Api.php and tasks_Api.php files, according to your servers.

### Prerequisites

PHP 7
MySQL

### Installing

Copy files to web server and modify as stated in "Getting Started"

## Running the tests

To run tests, please import test.sql to MySQL and go to index.php. You should be able to add new user, and also edit and delete him. For every new operation a list should be displayed. There´s also a button to list the tasks already stored in the database. The code isn't already able to create a new task.
